# Hackattic Solutions

My solution to [hackattic](https://hackattic.com) challanges.

- organised as node.js program (some challanges uses npm and pnpm as package manager).
- packages folder contains utility function way to solve indivisual challanges.
- src folder contains index.{ts, js} with main entry point.

## Getting started

To run any challanges create a `.env` file contains your *TOKEN* inside your challange folder.

```bash
    cd <challange-name>
    npm i
    # or
    pnpm i
    npm dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
```
